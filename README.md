Bachelor thesis project: Developing a Machine Learning Model for Microclimate Forecasting using CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, and SVR

This repository contains my **Bachelor Thesis project** on developing predictive models for **microclimate forecasting** (temperature, humidity, rainfall).  
The work integrates **real-world sensor data** with advanced ML models to analyze spatial and temporal variability and correlations with water consumption.

## Models Used
- Linear Regression, SVR  
- XGBoost, Random Forest  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)  
- Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)  

## Results
- Achieved RÂ² up to **0.85** for forecasting microclimate variables.  
- Explored links between microclimate fluctuations and **sustainable water management**.  

## Tools & Libraries
Python, Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, Matplotlib
